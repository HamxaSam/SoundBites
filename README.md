SoundBites
==========

SoundBites, environment recognition through sounds. This is an application which puts my research into audio environment recognition.

(Theoretically) Works in counterpart with SoundBitesMonkey, an Android service: http://github.com/williamberg/SoundBitesMonkey

My project report (which partially explains this code) is available at: http://bio-gen.co.uk/res/Project_report.pdf
